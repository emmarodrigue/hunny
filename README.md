# Hunny
- 	Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Saron Abebe, Kody Gentry, Isaac Jaramillo, Thahn Pham, and Emma Rodrigue.
-	What you’re creating?
Hunny is a blind dating web application that allows users to find their match based on personality before looks.
-	Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Hunny is for those who are looking to meet new people that want a genuine connection past appearance. 
-	Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
We hope to break a user's cycle of falling for the wrong type by avoiding the overwhelming expectations of appearance.
