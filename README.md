# Hunny
- 	Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Saron Abebe, Kody Gentry, Isaac Jaramillo, Thanh Pham, and Emma Rodrigue.
-	What you’re creating?
Hunny is a blind dating web application that allows users to find their match based on personality before looks.
-	Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Hunny is for those who are looking to meet new people that want a genuine connection past appearance. 
-	Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
We hope to break a user's cycle of falling for the wrong type by avoiding the overwhelming expectations of appearance.
	
# **Project Status:**
- ## We have:
	- the basic structure of our project complete using the Django framework along with most of the pages that we are planning on implementing in the future.
	- the ability to sign up for our app and also sign in using the appropriate credentials.
	- the base of our UI complete, but we need to diverge on an overall style and format.
	- few functionalities in our pages, this is the main focus in our next sprint.
- ## **Next steps:**
	- creating a uniform and aesthetic look to our UI with styling and structure
	- giving our pages more functionality including: 
		- home page UI displaying other users profiles 
		- uniform nav bar to switch between all pages
		- like/dislike another user
		- send and recieve messages with matches
		- location tracking and radius
		- animations (like/dislike, home page scrolling, loading, misc.)
