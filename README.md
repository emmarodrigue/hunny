# Hunny
- 	Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Saron Abebe, Kody Gentry, Isaac Jaramillo, Thanh Pham, and Emma Rodrigue.
-	What you’re creating?
Hunny is a blind dating web application that allows users to find their match based on personality before looks.
-	Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Hunny is for those who are looking to meet new people that want a genuine connection past appearance. 
-	Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
We hope to break a user's cycle of falling for the wrong type by avoiding the overwhelming expectations of appearance.

		- **Sprint 1**
        - Work was done on emma branch during the first sprint then on the develop branch for the remaining sprints.
        - [Configured hunny_app/views.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/views.py) to edit and save user information, and to verify that the user 
          is logged in before attempting to edit a profile to ensure that only their profile is being updated.
        - [Configured hunny_app/forms.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/forms.py) to create a form where the user can enter their personal information.
        - [Configured hunny_app/models.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/models.py) to set restrictions for the type of data a user can enter.
        - [Configured hunny_app/urls.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/urls.py) to set routes for the profile and edit profile pages.

        - [Created hunny_app/templates/edit_profile.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/edit_profile) to display the form to edit a user's profile.

        - [Linked templates related to the user's profile](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/demo/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/) to ensure that everything flows together and there is a seemless transition when moving from the edit profile page to the view profile page.
        - [Implemented the backend functionality for hunny_app/templates/profile_edit.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/profile_edit.html) so that the user's current settings are displayed when editing and changes can be saved.

        - [Created hunny_app/templates/preferences.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/preferences.html) to display a user's current match preferences.
        - [Created hunny_app/templates/preferences_edit.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/preferences_edit.html) to allow the user to change/update their match preferences.
        - [Modified hunny_app/templates/user.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/user.html) to include the correct routes and a logout button with correct functionality.

		- **Sprint 3**
		- [Modified hunny_app/models.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/models.py) to allow the user to upload up to three pictures to their account.
		- [Configured hunny_app/templates/preferences.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/preferences.html) and [hunny_app/templates/preferences_edit.html](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_app/templates/preferences_edit.html) to have a UI that matched the rest of the web application.
		- [Configured hunny_project/settings.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-f21-vulcans/hunny/src/develop/hunny_project/hunny_project/settings.py) to render the user's profile picture.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## What Went Well or Not
- We are all pretty familiar with the Django framework now.
- We have all of the backend implemented for our main features.
- We learned many backend and frontend techniques.
- We are getting more used to using git and didn't have to rely on others as much for help in that area.
- We are still having some issues with styling using Bootstrap on some of our pages, so not everything is rendering the same way.
 
- **Emma**
	- **Pro:** We were able to implement all of the main features that we originally wanted to include in the project.
	- **Con:** The file structure of our project still violates a lot of SOLID principles which led to some merge conflicts.
- **Kody**
	- **Pro:** We have a functional website at this point with many features. 
	- **Con:** We did not use a frontend framework and we aren't very experienced with frontend techniques.
## What We Can do to Improve
- We need to communicate more about what we're all looking for with new features since some people had disagreements about how some features were implemented.
- **Emma:** Create tests for the features that we have already implemented so that we can ensure no new developments will prevent parts of our features from working as expected. I already have experience using Selenium to automate test cases and think that my skills there would contribute more to the overall success of the project. I will add test cases to a test directory in our project to measure my improvement in this area.
- **Kody:** Fix the Messages model by storing each room in a Room model. Also I would need to create an algorithm to assign a match pair a unique ID for their room so each room is seperate. Store message objects better. The current model would be hard to handle with >1000 messages. 

## What is Currently Impeding Us from Performing Better
- Some of us have different ideas about what pages and features should be included in the project at this point.
- Although we have weekly meetings, commitments outside of class are preventing some of us from devoting more time to the project.
